<a href="https://climaguate.com/" target="_blank">www.climaguate.com</a> is a weather forecast website for Guatemala.
It provides up-to-date information about the weather in different regions of the country, including temperatures, atmospheric conditions, and short-term and long-term forecasts.


This website is a personal open-source project that demonstrates a full cloud solution with CI/CD and scalability using:
- Static web application using Azure Static Web Apps and Blazor Server
- Database storage using Azure SQL database with schema-based organization
- Weather data collection using Azure Functions and Python (every 15 minutes)
- Hourly forecast collection using Azure Maps Weather API (every 15 minutes)
- Air quality monitoring with AQI calculations
- Agricultural index and crop suitability recommendations
- City/crop recommendation assistant
- API documentation with Swagger-style UI
- CI/CD using GitHub Actions with multi-environment deployment
- IaC using Terraform for infrastructure management
- Secure configuration using Azure Key Vault


## Architecture Explanation

The diagram illustrates the architecture for a weather data collection, processing, and presentation system named Climaguate. The system is composed of several components working together to gather, process, and present weather-related data to end-users. 

![Climaguate Architecture Diagram](climaguate.png)


### 1. Data Collection (Scheduled Trigger)
This section is responsible for collecting weather data from various sources at scheduled intervals. It comprises several Python-based Azure Functions:

- **Current Weather Collector**: Collects real-time weather data from OpenWeatherMap API every 15 minutes for all configured cities
- **Air Quality Monitor**: Retrieves air quality data including AQI levels and individual pollutant concentrations (CO, NO, NO2, O3, SO2, PM2.5, PM10, NH3)
- **Hourly Forecast Collector**: Fetches 12-hour detailed hourly forecasts from Azure Maps Weather API every 15 minutes
- **Satellite Image Processor**: Downloads NASA GOES infrared satellite imagery, processes and crops images, adds location markers, and generates animated timelines

All these functions use Azure Functions for serverless execution and retrieve API keys securely from Azure Key Vault. The system includes comprehensive error handling and logging for monitoring and debugging.


### 2. Data Presentation
This section handles the processing and presentation of collected data. It involves:

- **Azure SQL Database**: Stores weather data in organized schemas (weather.WeatherData, weather.WeatherForecast, weather.AirQuality, agriculture.Crops, agriculture.CityCrops) with optimized indexes for hourly data queries
- **Data API Builder**: Automatically generates REST APIs from database stored procedures, converting SQL results to JSON format. Includes endpoints for weather, air quality, and agricultural recommendations.
- **Blazor Server Static Web App**: A responsive front-end application with interactive weather charts, collapsible UI sections, AQI color coding, agricultural index, crop suitability, and 24-hour forecast visualizations
- **Azure Blob Storage**: Hosts processed satellite images and animated weather timelines organized by city

The website features real-time weather displays, interactive forecast charts with precipitation and temperature data, agricultural recommendations, and animated satellite imagery showing cloud movement patterns.

### 3. CI/CD (Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment)
This section ensures that the codebase and infrastructure are consistently tested, integrated, and deployed. It includes:

- **GitHub Codespaces**: Provides a web-based development environment in Visual Studio Code, it is configured with all the required extensions so work can be resumed anywhere.
- **GitHub Actions**: Automates the build and deployment processes.

Code is committed to the Epivaral/climaguate repository on GitHub, which triggers the CI/CD pipelines by GitHub Actions.
There is one action for each component on the solution, that matches the folder structure: Infrastructure, Backend, Database, and Frontend.

### 4. End-Users
This section represents the final consumers of the weather data. The end-users can access the data through various devices:

- **Desktop Browsers**: Accessing the web application through [www.climaguate.com](http://www.climaguate.com).
- **Mobile Devices**: Viewing the weather data on smartphones and tablets via a responsive web application or a potential mobile app.


Additionally, there is an **Email Service** (in development) that will generate daily weather forecasts and send them to subscribers via email. Subscription will be available from the website once released.

### Summary
The Climaguate system is designed to efficiently collect, process, and present weather information to users via a web application. It leverages serverless functions for data collection, a robust database for storage, a .NET-based front-end for presentation, and an automated CI/CD pipeline for continuous improvement and deployment. 

This architecture ensures scalability, security, and ease of use for both developers and end-users.

# Our Logo
<img src="/frontend/Client/wwwroot/images/chaac.png" alt="Chaac - Maya God of Rain" align="right"/>
Chaac is the Maya god of rain. In Maya mythology, Chaac is considered an important deity who controls water and weather. He is depicted as a man with a large nose and sharp teeth, and carries a stone axe that he uses to strike the clouds and make it rain.

The ancient Maya relied on Chaac to ensure good harvests and maintain balance in nature. Even today, Chaac is revered in some indigenous communities in Guatemala as a symbol of fertility and prosperity.

The presence of Chaac in Climaguate is a reminder of the importance of water and weather in our lives. Through this website, we hope to provide accurate and useful information about the weather in Guatemala, including agricultural recommendations and crop suitability, so that people can be prepared and make informed decisions. 
Like Chaac, our goal is to help maintain balance and harmony in nature, and promote sustainability and environmental care.
